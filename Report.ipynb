    "## 1.1 Background\n",
    "Traffic accidents have become an increasingly important issue threatening people's public safety. In some cases, due to the lag of information, rescue organizations cannot understand the details of the accident in time, more and more vehicles are congested on the road, and the situation is getting worse...\n",
    "Therefore, if we can predict the severity of the accident based on the existing relevant data (such as road conditions, weather, etc.), it will help to make corresponding preparations when the accident occurs and buy time for the next action. Real-time reminders of traffic accident predictions can also help alleviate traffic pressure.\n",
    "## 1.2 Problem\n",
    "In this project we will predict the severity of an accident given the relative data like weather, road condition, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Interest\n",
    "The stakeholder of this project can be drivers who can use the prediction to get more careful o the traffic emergency  department to get more prepared for the possible accident."

Selected variables (data elements) relating to fatal and injury collisions for the collisions from 1999 to 2017. The data can be found [here](https://opendatatc.blob.core.windows.net/opendatatc/NCDB_1999_to_2017.csv) and the data dictionary [here](https://opendatatc.blob.core.windows.net/opendatatc/NCDB_Data_Dictionary.docx)"
