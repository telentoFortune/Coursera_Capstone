    "Traffic accident has been a more and more importante issue threatening peopleâ€™s public safety. Therefore, vehicle collision prediction based on relevant data and promptly reminding people may help to reduce accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will try to predict the severity of accidents given the data that could affact it, like weather, road condition, car speeding, etc. in the city **Seatle, USA.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholder of this project can be drivers who can use the prediction to get more careful o the traffic emergency  department to get more prepared for the possible accident."
